# Libft

Libft is the first project in the main 42 cursus. The goal is to make a lot of basic functions from maintream C librairies. For example, ft_strnstr must copy the exact behavior of strnstr

The Project features a Makefile creating a static library (libft.a) that can be use in almost every 42 project.
